## What is UX ##
This topic is broad so it will be divided into several posts.
Okay, so first let's get started from defitition. User Experience (UX) is fulfilment users needs, their analysis and reasearch. What is all this for? Imagine an online store and case when you can't delete item from the cart accidentaly added to them or situation when only form of payment is PayPal when you expected for example a card payment or American Express. Sounds annoying? Of course! That's why User experience designers exist in our world and create for us friendly interfaces for apps,websites and even more. The aim goal of User experience designers is to make the every processes we deal with every day much easier and faster. Seems to be easy to but UX is vast field that combines:
- psychology
- sociology
- analytics
- anthropology
-statistics

## Basic ##
Processes in User Experience depends on many things for example: Type of product which you're actually creating or target users for whom our product is intended. But if we want to make a good UX we should know the concept of "Design Thinking". It's the iterative process used by teams to understand users, their needs and on that basis,make assumptions, define problems and find a solutions for them. Design thinking is divided into 5 phases.  

- Emphatize
- Define
- Ideate
- Prototype
- Test  

But before doing anything,team must define the product and understand context of it's existance. In this phase interviewing key stakeholders it's really important to gather insights about business goals. Later it's will be crucial in made concept sketch of future product. About the sketches,the teams starts creating them on paper. It's cheaper and easier than using programms but creating problems with sharing wireframes with stakeholders. Wireframes is a concept product that demonstrates the content of the interface and arrangement of elements like text, buttons and etc. There are 3 types of wireframes:  
- Low Fidelity Wireframe
- Medium Fidelity Wireframe
- High Fidelity Wireframe  

In next part I describe we'll discover more secrets of the UX world.
