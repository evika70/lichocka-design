## How to get started? ##
Firstly ask yourself: What is a logo and what it's needed for? In my opinion the logo is a soul of company, brand or artist and identifies them. Good logo shows buyers and customers value of company and what it does. It's symbol that will represent them on any prints, conferences,shows,anywhere. We can't imagine new Iphone without bitten apple symbol right? That's why logo is very crucial for each brand and makes them unique.

## First steps ##
Research is good everywhere. We have 2021 and trillions of companies and created logos so competition is huge. But smart designer using analyzing the market can select what is the popular in design trends and add something new to this. Sometimes when we can't find idea for concept of logo analysis of market it's great solution. By looking at other designs we get a lot of inspiration we need to start creating our own idea.


## Style and colors ##
There is a lot of styles of logos. Think about for what kind of company you are creating a logo? Is this a elegant clothing store or maybe for a toy factory? Imagine a furneal home with a colorful logo and a funky font. Doesn't sound adequate. Remember that the logo must harmonize with company's goals. For example, if we make a design for international business companies the shape should be easy to remember. This is another important principle. The logo shouldn't be complicated and contain a lot of details. Color  also plays a big role in perception of the logo. It's more than just good looks. Color influences on customer. Let's take red. It's the color of desire. Mcdonald have a yellow letter "M" on red background. Why red? Because a hungry human craves food and red color increases that feeling.

## Typography ##
This is another important element in logo design. Proper typeface can influence on different interpretations of brand personality. We have three types of fonts:  

- serifs,
- sans serifs
- script

Imagine logo of financial institution with Comic Sans used. You'd probably think it was an unprofessional company. And it seemed to be just a font. But the font same as shape or color can make a particular impression. Like the previous cases it's a good idea to check the fonts used by your competitors and strike the balance.
