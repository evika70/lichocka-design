## How did it start?

When did I start thinking about graphic design as my future profession? Long time ago, really. I was maybe 10 years old and I was fascinated manga and anime. I loved drawing characters in this style. First in Paint, then in Gimp and few years later in Photoshop. I promised myself that I become the best graphic designer who will be creating a manga-style designs but that was stupid child's naive dream. It's not easy as i thought. But from the beginning...I graduated from a polygraphic technical school when I learned basic principles of DTP. It was a time when I learned to work with the programms used in printing houses or advertising agencies like Adobe Suite and Corel. At that time, I started doing my freelance jobs. I quickly realized that being a graphic designer isn't just a drawing pretty pictures as best we can. Is mainly a collaboration with difficult people and fulfilling their own vision. After graduating high school, I started college when I spent a lot of time on 3D environments learning to model in 3Ds Max. I was stuck between 2D and 3D graphics and that was the worst. Two completely different areas. And this is where I made my most important mistake. I started to explore both areas at the same time instead of choosing one specialization. When I started my first job,I moved away from graphic design for a while and I decided to try my hand in UV printing and laser engraving. It was a very big waste of precious time. I thought I'd become someone special by being able to do a lot of things...but I didn't. I wasn't really the best at anything. Do you remember the quote from my previous post? "If you want to have a great job and high salary you must be specialist!" After years of wasted time and wandering I decided to go in one direction: UI/UX design because it's future-oriented profession.

## Good tips:

- Think about which area of graphic design you are most interested in.
- Choose the most future-oriented profession.
- Analyze which graphics programs are most commonly used in jobs as a designer and learn them.
- Choose a school that will guarantee you an apprenticeship.
- Don't learn everything at once. First, learn one thing at a master level.
- Know your worth. If you're multi-tasking and are good at what you do, find an employer who will appreciate you.
- know about new trends in design. Don't do old style projects unless they require it of course.
- Never forget to make a portfolio and add there only your best designs.It should be in the form of website or page on Dribble / Behance or DeviantArt. Never make a PDF version of your portfolio,it's really unprofessional and makes recruiters nervous.
- Watch a lot of tutorials but don't copy them 1:1 ! By copying someone else's idea you don't learn anything new. Learn the technique shown and then interpret it in your own way.
- Learn graphic design software in English language! Whether you are from Europe, Asia or Africa, right now change the interface of your programs from native to english. With the ability to use programs in English, you can work for companies in any country.

## Should I Become a Graphic Designer?

Graphic design is first and foremost a flexible profession. You can earn money as a freelancer and as a remote worker even for a foreign company. It's a big convenience and big choice. When working as a graphic designer, expect crticism doon't get emotionally attached to your ideas. Sometimes it happens that you make a perfect design but your client says: "I don't like it". You have to be ready for it. Graphic design is for people who love to create brand style. For people who aren't afraid to design both small bussines cards and huge banners. Graphics provide many interesting challenges and requires constant learning of new trends and styles. If you're ambitious and computer work doesn't scare you - I don't see any objections.
