## Expectations and reality ##
If you've ever looked for job in IT, certainly you've seen thousand of job offers in differents places like big corporations or small startups. Each of them have a different requirements in both education and work experience. In large companies
recruiters look at the number of years you've worked in a profession. In this way it's easier to judge if you're a junior,mid or senior and they often require a clearly defined level of certain skills. But in small family businesses there's no often level division. You're just graphic designer, UI or Web Developer often without opportunities for advancement. But in both cases is one small common area: Requirements. Last week I saw a job offer for on UI designer and I paid attention to requirements such as: 

<span>&#8226;</span> Knowledge of Adobe suite (okay) \
<span>&#8226;</span> Use Sketch, Figma, Invision (okay) \
<span>&#8226;</span> HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript (wait...what?)

It's often the case in employment. In a lot of companies we can find a combination of Graphic designer / User Interface / User Experience and Front-end. Sounds scary when you imagine that you have to possess so many different skills. We ask ourselves: What for? After all, the same things can be done by 4 different people so why? 

**1)** Because it saves money for the entrepreneurs. Thay can hire one person instead of several and pay only one salary for fulfilling responsibilities in several sectors. \
**2)** Such an employee is self-sufficient. UI with the skills of a programmer and UX is able to create the product itself and sometimes is saving time. Sometimes because this kind of worker, it can be overworked and less productive. \
**3)** The multi-tasker person will teach next generation of employees who know how to do "everything".



## Where's the drawbacks? ##
Being multitasking seems to be okay but try to ask yourself in what speciality are you really master? Remember, you can't be good at everything. Choose your path and improve your skills in one main field. Moreover, employees who are a compilation of several different positions, often can only do the basics. If you want to have a great job and high salary you must be specialist! It's also important to know your worth. If you don't do this your employer may start taking advantage of you.
