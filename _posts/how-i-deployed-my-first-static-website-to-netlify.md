<h2><b>Short History</b></h2> 
Sometimes people love learn new things. They decide to deepen their education for example to find a better paying job or just increase skills. What about me? All life I've been going around graphic design and desktop publishing. But a technology is stil developing very quickly and maybe in 5 years the usual graphics designers won't be needed at all? Who knows...I decided to change my profession a little and add to my CV some new skills. A long time ago I though about programming but each time I was giving up. No time, nobody to help was making that web coding has become a big barrier for me. But just now I have an opportunity to try this once again because I have mentor and really admirable support from him. That's why I want to take this chance. <br><br>

**Needed tools**
* Netlify 
* Github 
* Git 
* Node.js 
* Visual Studio Code <br>


<h2><b>What’s the point for all of this?</b></h2>
So i started from Netlify. It’s platforms offers a hosting and serverless backend. Github is a platform that maintains source code. Git is open source version control system designed to handle small or very large projects. Node.js is a platform used to create of applications in JavaScritpt. And Finally Visual Studio Code being just a code editor. <Br>
 
After installation of all this things i run Git Bash application where I install manager for node.js using command: npm install - -global yarn. Before i check a git repository status i create a folder for my website project. In this localization I could add website template from github. Later I could create a local host preview using command: yarn dev. Later I could go to the browser to the localhost/3000. In this way I could see a  preview of my raw website. 
Final step was generate SSH key in Git Bash for GitHub. What is a SSH? (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. <br>
 
Now it time to run a Visual Studio code and starts editing my new portfolio website what I'll try to describe in next post.
