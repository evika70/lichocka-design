<span>&#8226;</span> Your portfolio need an upgreade? \
<span>&#8226;</span> Your client has been asking for hours when you will finish a project for them? \
<span>&#8226;</span> Maybe you have a lot of studying and your only meal during the day is coffe? \
<span>&#8226;</span> Last time you saw a list withtop design trends for 2021, but you don’t have time to learn it all? 


Don’t worry. I know all these cases and sometimes my head wants to explode from an excess of responsibilities. Someday there are days when you don’t know how to start a work. Now, when I’m older I've learned how to overocome time-wasters. I’ve prepared for you a 10 methods of time management.


## Limit the use of social media ##
I’m sure that you scroll a Facebook or Instagram every day. Have you ever wondered how many minutes or even hours it takes you to use your phone? No? So check it out. You’ll definitely be suprised. Designate a time during the day that you will spend using social media. For example 1 hour and not a minute more. You will see that your day will get longer.

## Turn off all notifications ##
When you start working on a project using a computer, sometimes you have open tabs with Facebook, Slack, LinkedIn...This is a huge mistake because any notification sounds distracts you from your tasks and as a result you waste time reading the messages.

## Write your tasks on a piece of paper ##
When you have a lot of things to do you won’t remember everything. Let help yourself and start using paper or platforms like Asana when you can manage your tasks. There are also platforms like Everhour which count the time you spend on a time. This should organize your activities throughout the day.

## Get enough sleep ##
Many times I’ve heard from deisgners that they are overworked and suffer from headaches. When I ask how much they sleep,the answer i hear is 4-6 hours per day. It’s not enough for our brains to rest. If we’re sleepy we will fill slowed down and sleepiness will prevent us from thinking creatively. Just try sleep regulary and you avoid a naps during the day.

## Don’t do several projects at once ## 
Sometimes we want to do do everything in one day. We start one project, abandon it after a while and start another. The question is why? Starting several things at once won’t help us to speed up. Try to finish one project first and then start another.

I think that if you try to follow the above advices, your performance at work will improve :)
